        The third tallest tower in the world also known as the CN tower.<br>
         The idea to make the CN tower came into the mind of the people at the canadian national railway in 1968 when they wanted to construct a large scale platform for tv and radio communication in the area of toronto. then was finally finished being built in 1972 after the 1570 workers would work 24 hours a day 5 days a week until completion. Now this tower is huge tourist attraction for the people that visit tornnto with a bunch of activities to do. such as the edge walk where you are able to lean off the end of the tower at 1168 feet in the air and many more.</div>
